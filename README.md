# Traffic

A logic puzzle game, which is a clone of the game "Rush Hour", where the goal is to move the red car to the exit. The game was created in C language.

## Getting Started

I wrote the C code as portable as possible, and the 'src' folder can be compiled using 'make'.

## Ideas To Implement

• More levels increasing in difficulty

• Save high score to a text file

• Random levels, instead of progressing to next level
